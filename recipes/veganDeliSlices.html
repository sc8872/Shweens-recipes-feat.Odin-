<p> A great! High protein recipe created by Natalie Mathews the "Fit Vegan Chef". I love these seitan these deli slices. I use these in my wraps, burritos, sandwiches, or even with a cheese and cracker snack! </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h5>10 servings</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>300g vital wheat gluten </li>
        <li>125g unflavored pea protien </li>
        <li>40g nutritional yeast</li>
        <li>1 tbsp + 1 tsp disired seasoning (make sure it has salt)</li>
        <li>8 cups of water (add more if needed)</li>

    </ol>

    <h3> Intructions </h3>
    
    <p> 1) Preheat oven to 350Â°F, line a baking pan with parchment paper, and lightly spray it with non-stick spray. </p>
    <p> 2) Measure the dry ingredients with a kitchen scale and add them to a large mixing bowl. Mix. </p>

    <p> 3) In a small mixing bowl, combine the wet ingredients and slowly add to the dry mix. Mix with your hands until reaching a bread dough consistency. (3-5 minutes) </p>
    <p> 4) Knead the mixture and roll 4 logs. Place them on the baking pan. </p>
    <p> 5) Cover the baking pan and bake for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, remove the cover, flip, and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes.</p>
    <p> 6) Once Seitan is cooked, let it completely cool before slicing (1hr+). 
    <p>Slice in a food processor or use a mandoline slicer.</p>
    <p> 7) Enjoy!</p>
